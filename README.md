# Hotel Revenue Analysis and Dashboard

# INSIGHT IN REVENUE GROWTH AND SHOULD THERE BE AN INCREASE IN PARKING SPACE

## Project Overview
This project encompasses the analysis of hotel revenue data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. It aims to provide key insights and visualizations through a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard includes metrics such as total revenue, average daily rate (ADR), and car park requests, with filters for year, hotel type, and country.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel:** Used for initial data exploration and preprocessing.
- **SQL:** Employed for data modeling and transformation.
- **Power BI:** Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Key Metrics and Visuals
### Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes the following key metrics:
- **Total Revenue:** The sum of all revenue generated by the hotels.
- **Total ADR (Average Daily Rate):** The average daily rate calculated across all hotel stays.
- **Total Car Park Requests:** The total number of car park requests made by guests.

#### Filters
- **Year:** Allows users to filter the data by specific years.
- **Hotel Type:** Allows users to filter the data by different types of hotels (e.g., luxury, budget, boutique).
- **Country:** Allows users to filter the data by country to view regional performance.

#### Visualizations
- **Revenue Over Time:** A line chart showing the trend of total revenue over the selected period.
- **ADR by Hotel Type:** A bar chart displaying the average daily rate segmented by hotel type.
- **Car Park Requests by Year:** A bar chart showing the total number of car park requests per year.
- **Revenue by Country:** A map visualization highlighting the total revenue generated in each country.

## SQL Analysis
This analysis involves the transformation and modeling of hotel revenue data using SQL. The goal is to prepare the data for visualization in Power BI, focusing on key metrics such as total revenue, total ADR, and total car park requests.

### Analysis Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Data was collected from various sources and stored in Excel files.
2. **Data Modeling:** SQL scripts were used to model the data, ensuring it was clean and structured for analysis.
3. **Data Transformation:** SQL queries transformed the raw data into meaningful metrics and aggregated the data by year, hotel type, and country.
4. **Export to Power BI:** The transformed data was exported to Power BI for visualization.

### Example SQL Script

WITH hotels AS (
    SELECT * FROM hotel_rev2018
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM hotel_rev2019
    UNION 
    SELECT * FROM hotel_rev2020
)
SELECT
    YEAR(hotel_date) AS Year,
    hotel_type AS HotelType,
    SUM(revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM
    hotels
GROUP BY
    YEAR(hotel_date), hotel_type
ORDER BY
    Year, HotelType;
